# Lifeledger

A chronicle of all 149 of my runs from 2016.

Made as part of the "King of the Internet" one-day hackathon with
[@abehaskins](https://github.com/abehaskins).


## Live Demo

See it in action [here](https://jwngr-5cb4b.firebaseapp.com/).


## Tech Stack

The app is built on top of React, Webpack, and Babel and uses the latest and greatest of the
JavaScript community. It was bootstrapped using
[`create-react-app`](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app) and I added in
[React Router](https://reacttraining.com/react-router/) into the mix.

The site was deployed for free onto [Firebase Hosting](https://firebase.google.com/docs/hosting/).

## Local Setup

```bash
$ git clone git@github.com:jwngr/lifeledger.git
$ npm install       # Install dependencies
$ npm start         # Start local dev server at http://localhost:3000/
$ npm run build     # Build for production
```

## Acknowledgements

Thanks to everyone who works on the open source technologies used for this website. I'm continually
amazed at how quickly the JavaScript world is moving, and it is fun to reap the benefits of that.

Also, a special shout out to [Gyroscope](https://gyrosco.pe/), which is probably my favorite app on
my phone and was used to generate the awesome running cards. Data for the cards came from
[Runkeeper](https://runkeeper.com/) and [FitBit](https://www.fitbit.com/).
